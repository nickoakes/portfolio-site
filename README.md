# Porfolio Site

A portfolio site to showcase all of my coding projects to date, built using Express routing and Pug templating. Landing page displays these projects within clickable links, each of which takes the user to the respective project page containing a description, screenshots and links to a live demo and GitHub repo.

Fonts, font colors and background colors changed.

Package.JSON modified so that 'npm start' launches the app.

Error handling middleware used to render an error.pug template when the user attempts to navigate to a non-existent route.
