The h2 element at the top of the page animates to indicate whether the letter chosen is correct or not. 'Game over' occurs either when the player correctly guesses all letters in the phrase, or when they have made five incorrect guesses and thereby lost all of their lives - represented by the heart shapes at the bottom of the screen. On 'Game over', an overlay is displayed to inform the user whether they have won or lost, and give them the option to start a new game.",
